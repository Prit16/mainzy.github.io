        <h1>Places To Visit In Bali</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>Bali is one of the most evocative places to visit in the entire Indonesian archipelago. A visit here sparks the senses. The intoxicating fragrance of incense and clove oil hangs in the thick tropical air. Peanuts sizzle at roadside stalls, petal-strewn offerings smolder on busy sidewalks, and traditional gamelan music jangles against the buzz of mopeds.</p>

                About 20 kilometers northwest of Kuta, Pura Tanah Lot ("Pura" means temple in Balinese) is one of Bali's most iconic temples. Its spectacular seaside setting, on a rocky islet surrounded by crashing waves, is a major wow factor.

                <br> For the Balinese people, it is one of the most sacred of all the island's sea temples. Every evening, throngs of tourists from Kuta, Legian, and Sanur find their way through a labyrinth of lanes lined by souvenir sellers to watch the sun setting behind the temple.

                <br> Pura Tanah Lot was built at the beginning of the 16th century and is thought to be inspired by the priest Nirartha, who asked local fishermen to build a temple here after spending the night on the rock outcrop.

                <br> Although foreigners can't enter any of the temples in the complex, you can walk across to the main temple at low tide. It's also fun to wander along the paths, taking photos and soaking up the magnificent setting

            <p>
                Every day in Bali's predawn darkness, hundreds of visitors begin the trek up the 1,700-meter summit of Mount Batur. Once at the top, they watch the sun rise above the lush mosaic of mist-shrouded mountains and the caldera far below. If you're looking for romantic things to do in Bali for couples, this should be top on your list.

                <br><br> This sacred active volcano lies in Kintamani District in Bali's central highlands, about an hour's drive from Ubud. The hike, along well-marked trails, is relatively easy and usually takes about two to three hours. Guided treks typically include a picnic breakfast, with eggs cooked by the steam from the active volcano. On a clear day, the views are spectacular, stretching all the way across the Batur caldera; the surrounding mountain range; and beautiful Lake Batur, the island's main source of irrigation water.

                <br><br> Sturdy hiking shoes are essential, and it's advisable to wear layers, as the temperature can be cool before sunrise.

                <br><br> You can also combine a trip here with a visit to one of Bali's most important temples, Pura Ulun Danu Batur, on the lake's northwest shore, and a therapeutic soak in hot springs at the beautiful village of Toya Bungkah on the banks of Lake Batur.

            <p>
                Uluwatu Temple (Pura Luhur Uluwatu) is one of the Bali's most famous temples, thanks to its magnificent clifftop setting. It presides over plunging sea cliffs above one of Bali's best surf spots.

                <br> In Balinese, "Ulu" means "tip" or "land's end," and "Watu" means rock, a fitting name for the location of the temple on the Bukit Peninsula, along the island's southwestern tip. Like Pura Tanah Lot, sunset is the best time to visit, when the sky and sea glow in the late afternoon light.

                <br> Archaeological finds here suggest the temple is of megalithic origin, dating from around the 10th century. The temple is believed to protect Bali from evil sea spirits, while the monkeys who dwell in the forest near its entrance are thought to guard the temple from bad influences (keep your belongings securely stashed away from their nimble grasp).

                <br> A scenic pathway snakes from the entrance to the temple, with breathtaking viewpoints along the way. Only Hindu worshippers are allowed to enter the temple, but the beautiful setting and the sunset Kecak dance performances that take place here daily are more than worth the visit.

            <p>
                Visiting the Monkey Forest, also known as the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, is one of the top things to do in Ubud, Bali. It's also one of the best places to visit in Bali if you're an animal lover or photographer. You can walk here in about 10 minutes from the town center in Ubud.

                <br> Besides the entertaining troops of grey long-tailed macaques that make their home here, a large part of the appeal is the evocative jungle setting where the monkeys roam free. Paved pathways lead through thick forests of giant banyan and nutmeg trees, where moss-covered statues and ancient temples loom through the dense foliage, imparting an almost mystical feel.

                <br> The forest is intended to represent the harmonious coexistence between humans and animals. It also conserves rare plants and is used as a location for researching macaque behavior, particularly their social interaction.

                <br> On the southwest side of the forest is one of the three temples found here: the 14th-century Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal. Here, hundreds of monkeys swing through the trees and clamber over the walls.

        <div class="c5">
            <p>
                Made famous by the book and movie Eat, Pray, Love, Ubud is also the epicenter of Balinese art and culture. This is where the modern Balinese art movement was born, with the surrounding royal palaces and temples acting as the main patrons.

                <br> Today, several excellent local museums and galleries celebrate its evolution and traditions. Art gazing is particularly rewarding here, as many collections are housed in traditional Balinese buildings surrounded by serene tropical gardens.

                <br> For an overview of Balinese art, your first stops should be Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA) and the Neka Art Museum, which lie within a short stroll of the Ubud Monkey Forest. Collections at both include works ranging from traditional to contemporary, including kris (ceremonial daggers), photography, and classical wayang (puppet-figure) paintings.

                <br> Other art galleries and museums in the Ubud area that might be of interest to art lovers include Setia Darma House of Masks & Puppets featuring ceremonial masks from Asia and beyond; Museum Puri Lukisan, spanning a range of Balinese artistic styles; and the Don Antonio Blanco Museum, at the artist's former home and studio.

                <br> If shopping for art is more your style, don't miss the Ubud Art Market. This labyrinth of stalls brims with carvings, sculptures, jewelry, sarongs, paintings, and homewares and is one of the top tourist attractions in Ubud. Bargaining is essential, and a good rule of thumb is to counter with half the asking price and barter upwards from there, always with a smile.

            <p>
                <br> Want to visit the beautiful emerald-hued rice fields that you see on all the Bali tourist brochures and Instagram posts? The Tegallalang or Jatiluwih rice terraces should be at the top of your sightseeing list — especially if you're a photographer.

                <br> About a 30-minute drive north of Ubud, Tegallalang Rice Terraces are one of the most famous areas to photograph these iconic landscapes and absorb their timeless beauty. Be aware that locals ask for donations along the most popular trail through the rice fields here, and many request fees for entrance and parking along the road. A relaxing way to enjoy the lush landscapes is at one of the many restaurants and cafés overlooking the fields.
                
                <br> About a 90-minute drive from Ubud, the Jatiluwih rice terraces cover more than 600 hectares of rice fields along the hillsides of the Batukaru mountain range and tend to be less crowded than Tegallalang. You'll also find fewer tourist touts here, so it's easier to walk around and explore without being hassled.
                
                <br> Both of these locations use the traditional water management cooperative called "subak," a UNESCO-recognized irrigation system that dates to the 9th century.

            <p>
                The 17th-century Pura Ulun Danu Bratan is one of Bali's most picturesque temple complexes. It sits on a small island along the western shore of Lake Bratan, in the cool highlands of central Bali. Set against the imposing backdrop of Gunung Bratan, the thatched temples reflect on the lake, and when the water levels rise, they seem to float on its surface.

                <br> Lake Bratan is one of Bali's main sources of irrigation and drinking water, and the temple complex is dedicated to Dewi Danu, goddess of the sea and lakes.

                <br> An unusual feature is the Buddhist stupa on the left of the entrance to the first courtyard, with figures of Buddha meditating in the lotus position in niches on the square base. The stupa reflects the adoption of Buddhist beliefs by Balinese Hindus.

                <br> The best time to visit this sacred Hindu temple complex is early in the day, before the tourist buses arrive. The temple is especially picturesque in the soft morning light, when cool mist sometimes cloaks the lake and the mountains beyond. You can also hire a canoe and paddle out on the lake to explore the meru (thatched shrines) at close range.

                <br> Not far from the temple complex, the Bali Botanic Garden (Kebun Raya Bali) is also worth a visit, with its beautiful bamboo forests, begonias, orchid collection, and medicinal plants.

            <p>
                Craving a slower-paced Bali, without the crowds, traffic, and tourist touts? The Nusa Islands are where you'll find it. They are also a great place in Bali for couples who crave a little more serenity than they might find on the mainland.

                <br> The most popular of the three islands is Nusa Lembongan, about 20 kilometers offshore from Sanur and easily accessible by speedboat. Surfing, snorkeling, diving, kayaking, and stand up paddleboarding are the main activities here, and the top attractions include beautiful Dream Beach; Mushroom Bay; and the Devil's Tears rock outcrop, with views of crashing surf erupting over the rocks. Many locals still make their living from seaweed farming, and you can watch them harvesting it by the shore.

                <br> The neighboring island, Nusa Ceningan, lies just over a bridge from Nusa Lembongan, with a beautiful blue lagoon.

                <br> The largest of the island trio, Nusa Penida, is a quick boat ride away. Rock formations, caves, and a bird sanctuary are Nusa Penida's top draws, and diving is one of the most popular things to do here, with the chance to see manta rays, sunfish, and turtles. Don't miss the steep hike down to Kelinking Beach, also known as T-Rex Bay, to bask on your own slice of golden sand, backed by soaring sea cliffs – it's one of the top beaches in Asia.
