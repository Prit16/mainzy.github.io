            If you want to witness New Year celebrations and attend the Dubai Shopping Festival, the duration between December end to mid-February is the perfect time to visit Dubai.

                If you have heard of artificial islands but never been to one, you definitely need to visit The Palm Islands. The Palm Islands is the collective of two different artificial islands situated mainly in Palm Jumeirah and Palm Jebel Ali. While the island in Palm Jumeirah is complete and can be visited by the tourists, the one in Jebel Ali is still not completed yet which is why you can’t visit that yet. The islands are named so because of the shape it takes. The majority of the tourists and even the ex-pats suggest viewing the islands from either in the air or from any of the popular skyscrapers around in Dubai like that of the Observation Deck in the Burj Khalifa.

                <br> Highlights: Hire a speedboat at Palm Jumeirah to explore the entire island around.
                <br> Price: $36-$50 for a complete island tour
                <br> Ideal for: Family, Friends, Kids
                <br> Location: coast of Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
