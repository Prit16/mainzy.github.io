            <h1>1. NAME ORIGIN</h1>
            <p>
                During the Neolithic era, the island was called Strongoli (meaning “of round shape”).
                Years later, the island’s name was changed to the Kalliste (meaning “the most beautiful one”) and then, after the Greek independence, it was referred to as Thira after its capital city.
                The name ‘Santorini’ is a contraction of the words “Santa” and “Irene” from the name of the old cathedral in the village of Perissa. Although,
                “Thira” remains the official name of the island.

                As is the case throughout all of the islands of the Cyclades, Santorini is abundant with more than 600 temples of all shapes and sizes. Although most of them are quite small, it is believed that there are more churches than residential houses on the island. A lot of them are also private.

            <h1>6. THE LOST ATLANTIS</h1>
            <p>
                Santorini is thought to be one of the possible locations for Atlantis. This is likely because historians have noticed the Minoan settlement of Akrotiri, discovered on the island of Santorini, was a developed settlement that was destroyed around 1,500 BC due to the strong eruption of the Santorini volcano matching the myth of Plato.
