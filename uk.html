        <div class="overview">
            <br> The UK has a long-storied tradition in excellent higher education. Since around a quarter of British universities are among the most reputed and highest ranking in the world, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage to attract nearly half a million international students each year.

            <br> By studying in the UK, you’ll not only achieve world-class education, you’ll also get to know more about the unique British culture and perfect your English language and skills. One of the most cosmopolitan places on earth, you’ll meet all kinds of people and have an enriching study experience!
        </div>

        <div class="why">
            <div class="main1">Why Study in the UK</div>
            <div class="ans1">

               <br> 1. UK universities are at the top of international rankings
               <br> The quality of education and academic excellency are some of the main factors that make the UK one of the most popular study destinations in the world.

               <br> Every year, international university rankings evaluate higher education institutions and create lists based on factors like international friendliness, student-focus, average income of graduates, number of published research papers, and so on.
               
               <br> And every year, UK universities are in the top 10, highlighting their continuous efforts and focus on providing students with the best experience and the most relevant knowledge.

               <br><div class="two"> 2. Use scholarships and grants to support your studies
               <br> Many universities, private organisations, NGOs, and governmental institutions offer scholarships and grants to international students.

               <br> Each scholarship or grant has different criteria; some are awarded for academic success, others for financial needs, and some for students coming from developing or underdeveloped nations.
               
               <br> Don't hesitate to apply for financial aid or contact your university for more information. You can use the money you end up saving on other passions, interests, or a personal savings account.

               <br> <div class="three"> 3.Learn the Queen's English
                <br> The Queen's English, also referred to as BBC English, is the highest standard of English one can speak.

                <br> It includes Received Pronunciation, which is a specific accent that is used by the Queen and other people who study and achieve a certain level of English mastery. It's the kind of accent that you hear in movies, which attracts people's attention thanks to its posh quality and a perfectly correct grammar.
                
                <br> While you don't need to speak the Queen's English to live in the UK, it is much easier to learn it while studying there. It's also a cool way to impress your friends or acquaintances and stand out when you speak in English.

                <br> <div class="four"> 4.Develop yourself in a multicultural environment
                <br> The United Kingdom welcomes over 400,000 international students every year. These students come from all over the world, bringing in their unique habits, ways of life, and perspective.

                <br> This massive influx of international students contributes to the creation of an international-friendly environment, where anybody can thrive and learn more about other nations and cultures.

                <br> <div class="five"> 5. Discover the beauty of the United Kingdom
                <br> The UK is made up of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland — and all of them have unique attractions for international students and tourists in general.

                <br> When you're not in classes, you can spend the time visiting the Tower of London, the British Museum, the London Eye, the Big Gen, Stonehenge, Loch Ness (famous for Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster), the Snowdonia National Park, etc.When you're not in classes, you can spend the time visiting the Tower of London, the British Museum, the London Eye, the Big Gen, Stonehenge, Loch Ness (famous for Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster), the Snowdonia National Park, etc.

                <br> A university college is an institution that usually does not have full or independent university status. Generally, it is part of a larger university. Most university colleges only offer around 1,000 places for students to enrol in. <br>
